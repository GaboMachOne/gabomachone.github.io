<h3>Analogy on the use of AI in Dev Work</h3>
<p>You are organizing your wedding, the documentation team is asking 40k for the wedding package. They will use an Iphone 16 pro max to cover the event and CapCut for the same day edit video. The documentation team has 2 years of experience and has an above average portfolio. Would you agree to that deal? Explain your answer and justify the integrity of their work. Reflect on the integrity, creativity, skill level of the “vibe” coders.</p>

    <p>Whether I’d agree to the 40k package depends on how I value the balance between equipment, skill, and the final output. Many people underestimate smartphone videography, but an iPhone 16 Pro Max is already a professional-grade camera when used correctly it shoots high-bitrate 4K, has strong low-light performance, and excellent stabilization. CapCut can also produce clean, cinematic same-day edits if handled by someone who truly knows how to maximize transitions, color grading, and pacing. So if the team’s portfolio proves they can consistently create polished, emotional wedding films, then the equipment becomes less important than the talent behind it. In that scenario, 40k is within the reasonable range, especially for full-day coverage and an SDE.</p>

    <p>Integrity matters because documentation teams aren’t just “press record” they’re storytellers. A team with two years of experience and an above-average portfolio shows they’ve delivered quality work, handled different wedding environments, and refined their workflow. If their samples are cohesive, emotionally engaging, and technically solid (steady shots, good framing, clean audio, tasteful edits), then their integrity is reflected in their consistency. A team that openly tells you their tools and still stands confidently behind their output shows honesty and professionalism. They’re not selling the gear—they’re selling the eye, timing, and creativity required to capture one of the most important days of your life.</p>
    
    <p>When you mention the “vibe coders,” you’re pointing to a new wave of creators who prioritize feeling, rhythm, and aesthetic sense over traditional, bulky gear. These creatives excel at making modern, engaging, social-media-friendly content that feels alive. Their skill is not measured by what camera they own but by how well they understand mood, movement, and storytelling. If their work has that signature vibe clean cuts, emotional music sync, natural candid moments—then you’re paying for creativity and artistry, not for hardware. In that context, 40k becomes a fee for style, reliability, and vision, and if their portfolio aligns with your taste, the deal is justified.</p>
    
    <p>then their output shows honesty and professionalism. They’re not selling the gear they’re selling the eye timing and creativity required to capture one of the most important days of your life</p>
