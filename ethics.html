<h2>Ethical Use of AI</h2>

    <h3>Responsible use in the academe</h3>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to address some of the biggest challenges in education today, innovate teaching and learning practices, and accelerate progress towards SDG 4. However, rapid technological developments inevitably bring multiple risks and challenges, which have so far outpaced policy debates and regulatory frameworks. UNESCO is committed to supporting Member States to harness the potential of AI technologies for achieving the Education 2030 Agenda, while ensuring that its application in educational contexts is guided by the core principles of inclusion and equity.

    <h3>Avoiding plagiarism and misuse</h3>
    <p>AI tools like ChatGPT can generate entire essays within seconds. While this might seem like an easy solution for a last-minute assignment, submitting AI-generated work without proper attribution is considered plagiarism at most institutions. Even though the content is technically "original" (in that it is not copied from another student or source), it does not reflect your own analysis, understanding, or critical thinking. Some universities even classify AI-generated submissions as contract cheating, the same category as hiring someone to write an essay for you.</p>

    <p>paraphrasing tools, such as QuillBot or Wordtune, can reword existing content to avoid direct copying. However, if an AI tool rewrites a passage from a source without properly citing it, this is still plagiarism. Even if the words are different, the ideas and structure remain the same.</p> 
    
    <p>Additionally, AI paraphrasing tools sometimes produce text that is inaccurate or misleading, changing the meaning of the original source. This can lead to academic dishonesty, even if unintentional. Proper citation and critical engagement with the material are essential when using AI-assisted paraphrasing.<p>
    
    <h3>Accuracy and verification of AI outputs</h3>
    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is used in many business fields, such as academic, scientific, and artistic practices. When searching for in-depth answers about a specific topic, AI generators can be asked to summarize and define the topic. Knowing where the information comes from and what databases the AI platform pulls from is critical. When using AI for a research project, individuals should double-check the credibility of the information to mitigate the risk of potential bias or irrelevant sources that are not up to date. With the research in this document, we asked various questions to investigate the AI output’s credibility, accuracy, and relevance using Chat GPT and Microsoft Copilot. Our study found that AI provides a comprehensive overview of the subject an individual is inquiring about. However, in some circumstances, AI failed to provide specific facts that would otherwise build a more excellent rapport with an audience. Bias was detected when asking questions that were influenced by political controversy. Furthermore, AI software is ineffective for researching current events, as Chat GPT’s last update was in 2022.
    A diverse range of outputs, from data analysis to creative innovation, AI-driven technologies are reshaping industries and enhancing productivity. By implementing the techniques and recommendations discussed in this research, individuals will be confident in their ability to use AI and know what additional avenues to take when fact-checking AI platform output.</p>

    <h3>Bias and fairness</h3>
    <p>AI bias refers to systematic errors in AI systems that lead to unfair or skewed outcomes. This can include issues such as incorrect predictions, a high false negative rate or decision-making that disproportionately affects marginalized groups. This is based on prejudiced assumptions made in its development and deployment, like during AI data collection and preparation.</p>
       
    <p>quick example would be using AI in hiring machine learning algorithms. An HR machine learning model can be trained on biased historical data that favors candidates from certain schools or with certain merits. This can lead to hiring decisions that perpetuate inequality and limit diversity and talent, which can be a significant problem in creating a fair and inclusive workplace. And also, legal troubles such as discrimination lawsuits.</p>
        
    <p>Fairness generally refers to acting impartial and just, without favoritism or discrimination.
    In AI, fairness refers to ensuring that systems operate in that way – equitably. In other words, since AI and machine learning (ML) process lots of data, fairness involves using this data responsibly and making decisions that avoid unjustified adverse effects on any individual or group.</p>
    <p> AI fairness is also important if we want the widespread acceptance and adoption of AI systems. This is because we want to be able to trust that AI can make the right and fair decisions. Especially if we plan on introducing AI into business and more complex operations.</p>
        
    <p>addressing and eliminating bias is a crucial step to ensuring fair AI. For example, if you catch and mitigate bias in training data you can reduce the likelihood of unfair outcomes.</p>

    <h3>Your own recommended guidelines</h3>
    <p>Privacy and Confidential Data
    Never input private, sensitive, or personal information into AI tools unless the platform explicitly guarantees secure handling.Avoid sharing:
    1. Personal identifiers
    2. Student information
    3. Financial or medical details
    4. Confidential documents</p>
    
    <p> Academic Integrity
    Use AI to explore ideas, get feedback, or clarify concepts—not to generate entire assignments.Your learning should remain the primary goal.</p>
    
    <p> Not Use AI for Harm
    Avoid generating or spreading:
    1. Misinformation
    2. Deepfakes
    3. Hate speech
    4. Dangerous instructions
    Always consider the social impact of what you create.</p>
