<h2>A. GenAI FAQs</h2>


<h3>What is Generative AI?</h3>
    <p> Generative AI can be thought of as a machine-learning model that is trained to create new data, rather than making a prediction about a specific dataset. A generative AI system is one that learns to generate more objects that look like the data it was trained on. artificial intelligence or AI tools use machine learning models trained on massive pools of information to learn patterns from data to create novel content like text, images, audio, or video in response to a prompt. Unlike internet searches, generative AI tools do not use algorithms to locate and curate existing sources. Instead, they create new content by predicting what word, sound, or pixel would come next in a pattern.
    And despite the hype that came with the release of ChatGPT and its counterparts, the technology itself isn’t brand new. These powerful machine-learning models draw on research and computational advances that go back more than 50 years. Capabilities can vary significantly by tool, and paid versions of generative AI tools often have specialized functions.</p>

<h3> How does it work?</h3>
    <p>For example, ChatGPT 4o, the most recently released version of the most widely used generative AI tool, ChatGPT, allows users to interact with the AI using voice and images rather than just text and create and train enclosed GPTs to perform specific functions. Some generative AI tools, consistently integrating real research into text remains a weak functionality. Some AI tools, for example, can produce text with a reference list or superscripts with links to sources, but the references often do not correspond to the text created or are fake citations made of a mix of real publication information from multiple sources. More-recently released or updated tools, Bing Copilot, have more-sophisticated research integration capabilities.</p>

<h3> What are examples of GenAI tools?</h3>
    <p>Examples & Types of GenAI 
    Text and conversational AI
    ChatGPT: An OpenAI chatbot for generating text, summarizing, translating, and answering questions.
    Gemini (formerly Bard): A Google AI chatbot that handles text, images, audio, and video.
    Claude AI: A large language model from Anthropic for conversational interactions and code generation.
    Microsoft Copilot: An AI assistant integrated into Microsoft products for tasks like drafting emails and answering questions.
    Grammarly: An AI writing assistant for content generation, grammar correction, and personalization.<p>
    
    <p>Image and video generation
    DALL-E 3: An OpenAI tool that generates realistic images from text descriptions.
    Mid journey: An AI image generator known for high-quality and artistic results.
    Adobe Firefly: An AI tool for generating images with integration into Adobe's photo editing software.
    Synthesia: A platform that uses AI to create videos from text, including realistic avatars.
    Runway: An AI video tool for creative video generation.<>
    
    <p>Code generation
    GitHub Copilot: An AI pair programmer that provides code suggestions and completion.
    Microsoft Copilot: Assists with code generation and completion within development environments.
    AWS CodeWhisperer: An AI coding companion from Amazon Web Services. </p>

<h3> What can GenAI do (strengths)?</h3>
    <p>GenAI can produce what seems like diverse and original outputs. It can create content through capturing nuances in language, based on patterns which we may not have seen before in the data they were trained on. This helps to open up different perspectives and can give us ideas on how to explore topics from a variety of viewpoints.<p>

    <p>Gen AI can process and interpret human language in a conversational style, which allows it to generate contextually relevant responses to user prompts. It can also reformulate text to simplify or summarise it, which can help people start to understand more complex ideas.</p>
  
    <p>GenAI is also anticipated that most industry and workplaces will be using a form of Generative AI in the future to enhance and optimise their work. Gen AI is already integrating into our daily learning and work tools, such as Copilot within Microsoft Office, or the AI content generator in Grammarly. So it is important to develop your skills in using Gen AI effectively and ethically. If used appropriately, Gen AI can be a great leveller for those who do not speak English as their first language or may not have the same literacy or language skills as others.<p>

<h3> What are its limitations or risks?</h3>
    <p>AI can be inconsistent:This can happen more frequently than some other AI-based outputs. When provided the same input, outputs can vary quite significantly due to the statistical nature of the models. This can pose several challenges when there is a need to rely on predictable, repeatable behaviour.</p>

    <p> AI can be biased:As with other AI models, generative AI models are trained on data sets and when this data contains bias it is reflected in the output of the model. Examples have been seen with text to image generators, which generate outputs that amplify gender and racial stereotypes or chatbots that demonstrate political bias.</p>

    <p>AI can be inaccurate: Generative AI can help spread misinformation. Part of this is due to the potential of models to “hallucinate” ie to create false data and confidently rely on it. The current iteration of text-based generative AI models can be easily led, can make up quotes and references, and even contradict themselves when challenged, meaning they are not always a reliable source of truth. One infamous example was where generative AI was used to prepare for a court case, and it suggested examples of historical cases that were later found to be fictional.</p>


<h3> Any other FAQs you want to add.</h3>
    <p>GenAI always give correct information? Not always. GenAI can produce hallucinations confident but incorrect outputs so verification is essential.</p> 

    <p>Is GenAI safe to use? Yes, but with caution. AI tools may have privacy, bias, or accuracy issues. Always check terms of use and avoid entering confidential information.</p>
  
    <p>Can GenAI replace humans? GenAI is designed to assist, not replace, human creativity and judgment. Human oversight is still required in education, workplaces, and research.</p>
  
    <p>Does using GenAI count as plagiarism? It depends on the context. AI-generated content must be properly acknowledged when required by schools, workplaces, or publication standards.</p>
